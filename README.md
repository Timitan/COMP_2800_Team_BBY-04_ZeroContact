## Inspiration

This game was largely influenced by interactive story games such as Reigns and Sort the Court as well as survival games such as 60 Seconds.


## Setup
We recommend using a IDE with a built in terminal (Visual Studio Code or IntellliJ IDEA for example) to simplify the installation of the dependencies. You can also use the command line built into your operating system and navigate to the project folder.

MongoDB was used for this project and we recommend that a cluster is created before moving forward.

To start, open a terminal in the root directory. You will need to install the dependencies that are listed in the package.json file in the root directory. Use "npm install" to install the following dependencies:

- ejs
- bcryptjs
- express
- mongodb

Afterwards, you can change the DB_URL constant in the credentials.js file in the root directory to the connection string that points to the MongoDB database of your choice.
